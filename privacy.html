            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>At IntelliWiz Technologies ("we," "our," or "us"), we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application, <strong>Sync Party</strong>, handles information when you use our services. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Sync Party is designed to function with minimal data collection. We categorize data collection as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Local Network Data:</strong> To synchronize music between devices, the app requires access to your Local Network. This is used solely to discover and connect to nearby devices. We do not store or transmit this data to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Metadata:</strong> The app accesses the titles of the MP3 files you select for playback to sync them across devices. This information remains local to your device session.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous diagnostic data (e.g., crash reports) via Apple’s standard App Store tools to help us improve the app.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Device Permissions and Local Connectivity</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">To provide the core functionality of synchronized music playback, "Sync Party" requires access to specific hardware features on your iOS device. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding these permissions.</p>
            
            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900 mb-2">3.1 Local Network Access</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The App uses Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework to discover other devices running "Sync Party" nearby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage:</strong> This permission is strictly used to identify valid Host or Guest devices to establish a connection session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> No data regarding your local network structure, other devices, or internet traffic is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-blue-900 mb-2">3.2 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These radio technologies are used to establish a direct, peer-to-peer connection between devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-1 space-y-1 text-gray-700">
                            <li><em>Bluetooth:</em> Used to broadcast and scan for nearby sessions with low power consumption.</li>
                            <li><em>Wi-Fi:</em> Used to transfer audio files and synchronization commands between connected devices with high speed and low latency.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> While these technologies can technically be used for location estimation, <strong>Sync Party does not access, track, or store your geographic location.</strong> The use of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is limited exclusively to local data transfer.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Audio Files:</strong> Audio files shared during a session are stored in a temporary directory on the Guest device. These files are <strong>automatically deleted</strong> when the user disconnects or leaves the session. They are not added to the user's permanent music library or backed up to any cloud service.</li>
